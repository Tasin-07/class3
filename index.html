    <b>Description:</b> Hi,my name is Yeadur Rahman Tasin. You can call me Tasin in short.I am a student and i just completed my SSC(Seniour School Certificate) exam and the exam was pretty good. results will be published on 28 November 2022 which is just 1 day later. so I am really tensed. after the exam all the examinees got 2 months break so I decided to use my time efficiently. I was interested in the programming ssector for a very long time and also plan to study CSE in the future.So, I took my first step towards my dream by learning Web Development at eShikhon.
